This can be particularly concerning for individuals who already struggle with mental health issues or have a history of psychosis.

Furthermore, virtual reality can also be addictive, with some individuals becoming so engrossed in virtual experiences that they neglect their real-life responsibilities and relationships. This can lead to feelings of isolation and detachment from the real world, which can have negative consequences on mental health.

Overall, while virtual reality technologies have the potential to provide numerous benefits for mental health, it is important to approach their use with caution and mindfulness of their potential psychological impact. It is essential to use virtual reality in a responsible and balanced way to ensure that it enhances, rather than detracts from, overall mental well-being.
