Over time, these advantageous traits become more common within the population, leading to the evolution of new species.

Natural selection is driven by environmental pressures, such as competition for resources, predation, and changes in climate. Organisms that are better suited to their environment have a higher chance of survival and reproduction, leading to the gradual accumulation of beneficial traits within a population.

Response 32: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century. It states that species evolve over time through the process of natural selection, which acts on heritable traits that affect an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. Individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and pass on those traits to their offspring, leading to a gradual change in the population over generations.

This process of natural selection has a significant impact on biodiversity. It results in the adaptation of species to their specific environments, leading to the diversification of life forms. As species evolve and adapt to their surroundings, they may develop new traits or characteristics that help them better compete for resources, avoid predators, or withstand environmental challenges. This can lead to the emergence of new species and the formation of complex ecosystems with a wide range of species occupying different niches.

Overall, the theory of evolution by natural selection has played a crucial role in shaping the biodiversity of the planet. It has led to the incredible diversity of life forms we see today, from microscopic bacteria to towering trees and everything in between.
