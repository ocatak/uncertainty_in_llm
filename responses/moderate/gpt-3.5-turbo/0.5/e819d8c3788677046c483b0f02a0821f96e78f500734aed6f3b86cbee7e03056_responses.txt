4. Infrastructure: Building the necessary infrastructure for renewable energy generation, such as wind farms and solar panels, can be a challenge due to land use issues and regulatory hurdles.

Advancements in renewable energy technologies include:

1. Improved efficiency: Advances in technology have led to increased efficiency in renewable energy sources, allowing for more energy to be generated from the same amount of resources.

2. Energy storage: Research into new battery technologies and other forms of energy storage, such as pumped hydro storage, are helping to address the issue of intermittency in renewable energy sources.

3. Grid integration: Smart grid technology is helping to integrate renewable energy sources into the existing grid system, allowing for better management of energy flow and distribution.

4. Policy support: Government policies and incentives, such as tax credits and renewable portfolio standards, are helping to drive the adoption of renewable energy technologies and make them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels.
