These variations may be beneficial, neutral, or harmful to the individual's ability to survive and reproduce in their environment.

Natural selection occurs when individuals with advantageous traits have a better chance of surviving and reproducing, thus passing their beneficial traits on to the next generation. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to evolutionary change. Conversely, individuals with harmful traits are less likely to survive and reproduce, leading those traits to become less common in the population.

The impact of natural selection on biodiversity is profound. It is the driving force behind the diversity of life on Earth, as species evolve and adapt to different environments and changing conditions. Natural selection leads to the development of new species, as well as the extinction of others that are unable to compete or survive in their environment.
