Overall, the United Nations serves as a vital forum for multilateral cooperation and diplomacy, providing a platform for member states to address shared challenges and work together to maintain international peace and security. While the UN is not without its limitations and criticisms, it remains an essential organization for promoting peace, security, and stability in the world.

One of the main functions of the United Nations in maintaining international peace is the prevention and resolution of conflicts. The UN Security Council has the authority to take action to address threats to international peace and security, including the authorization of peacekeeping missions, sanctions, and diplomatic interventions.
