Response 19: The Great Depression was a severe economic downturn that lasted from 1929 to the late 1930s. There were several factors that contributed to its onset:

1. Stock market crash: The Great Depression was triggered by the collapse of the stock market on October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday. Investors panicked and sold off their shares, leading to a massive decline in stock prices.

2. Bank failures: As a result of the stock market crash, many banks went bankrupt as people rushed to withdraw their savings. This led to a widespread banking crisis and credit contraction, further worsening the economic situation.

3. Overproduction and underconsumption: Industries were producing goods at a faster rate than consumers could afford to buy them. This imbalance led to a surplus of goods, causing prices to fall and businesses to cut production and lay off workers.

4. High tariffs and trade barriers: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 raised tariffs on imported goods, leading to retaliatory measures by other countries. This, in turn, reduced international trade and further weakened the global economy.

The Great Depression had far-reaching effects on society, including:

1. Unemployment: Millions of people lost their jobs as businesses closed down or reduced their workforce. Unemployment rates soared to over 25% in some countries, leading to widespread poverty and hardship.

2. Homelessness and poverty: Many families lost their homes and were forced to live in shantytowns known as "Hoovervilles." People struggled to afford basic necessities like food and clothing, leading to widespread deprivation.

3. Social unrest: The economic hardship of the Great Depression fueled social unrest and protests. Groups like the Bonus Army marched on Washington, demanding payment of bonus payments promised to World War I veterans.

4. Protective tariffs and trade wars: The U.S. government implemented protective tariffs, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, in an attempt to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. However, these tariffs had the unintended consequence of damaging international trade and exacerbating the global economic downturn.

The effects of the Great Depression were far-reaching and profound:
