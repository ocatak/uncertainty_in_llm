Response 8: The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin in his seminal work "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, explains how species evolve over time through a process driven by competition for resources, variation within populations, and the passing down of beneficial traits through generations. 

According to Darwin's theory, individuals within a population will vary in traits such as color, size, and behavior due to genetic differences. Some of these variations may make an individual better suited to survive and reproduce in a specific environment than others. Those individuals with more favorable traits will have a better chance of surviving and passing those traits on to their offspring, thus increasing those traits in the population over time.

This process of natural selection, where those individuals best adapted to their environment survive and reproduce, acts as a mechanism for diversity to arise in populations. Over time, this process can lead to the development of new species as populations accumulate enough genetic changes to become reproductively isolated.

The impact of evolution by natural selection on biodiversity is profound. It is responsible for the vast array of life forms on Earth, from single-celled organisms to complex plants and animals. As species evolve and adapt to changing environments, biodiversity increases, leading to the specialization of organisms to distinct niches and ecosystems.
