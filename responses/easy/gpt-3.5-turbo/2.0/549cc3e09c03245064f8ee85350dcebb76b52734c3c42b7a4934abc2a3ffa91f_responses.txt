Response 3: A camera captures an image through the use of special sensors embedded within it. When you point a camera at a subject and press the shutter button, light enters the lens and is focused onto these sensors.

The sensors work by transforming the light intensity at each point on the image into digital information in real-time. Each point on the sensor corresponds to a pixel which makes up the final image.

Once the light has been properly focused onto the sensors, they convert it into electric signals that get converted into a digital image file. This saved digital recording contains all the individual pixel values from every point on the sensor, ultimately producing a complete still image for retrieval/use.
Response 7: When a camera captures an image, light rays pass through the camera lens and onto the camera sensor. The sensor has millions of tiny pixels that convert the light into electrical signals. The camera's image processor then combines and processes these signals to form a digital image that represents the scene being photographed. This image is stored on a memory card or can be viewed on the camera's display screen. The various settings and adjustments on the camera, such as aperture, shutter speed, and white balance, determine how the light is gathered and processed to create the final image.
Response 12: A camera captures an image by allowing light into the lens, which focuses the light rays onto the image sensor or film. The sensor or film then records the light rays and converts them into an electronic signal or chemical interactions that represents an image. This process involves various parts and mechanisms in a camera working together to create the final image.
Response 15: A digital camera captures an image by allowing light to pass through the camera lens and onto a photosensitive surface or image sensor. When the light hits the sensor, it activates pixels which convert the light into an electrical signal. The camera processor then processes this signal into an image made up of pixels, with each pixel's brightness and color contributing to the overall image. The resulting image is then stored on a memory card as a digital file until it is viewed, printed, or transferred to a computer.
