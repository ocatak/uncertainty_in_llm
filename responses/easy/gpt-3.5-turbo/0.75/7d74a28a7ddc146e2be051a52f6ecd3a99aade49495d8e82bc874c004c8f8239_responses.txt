Once the water and detergent are mixed, the washing machine begins to agitate the clothes. Agitation is the back-and-forth motion of the drum inside the washing machine that helps to loosen dirt and stains from the fabric. 

During the wash cycle, the clothes are continually moved around in the water and detergent mixture. This movement helps to ensure that all areas of the fabric are cleaned thoroughly. 

After the wash cycle is complete, the washing machine drains the dirty water and rinses the clothes with clean water to remove any remaining detergent. Some washing machines also have a spin cycle, which helps to wring out excess water from the clothes before they are removed from the machine. 

Overall, the combination of water, detergent, and agitation in a washing machine works together to effectively clean clothes and leave them looking and smelling fresh.
Response 33: A washing machine cleans clothes by combining several key elements: water, detergent, agitation, and rinsing.
