1. Electric charge: All matter is made up of atoms, which are composed of positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and neutral neutrons. When electrons move from one atom to another, they create an electric charge. Objects with an excess of electrons are negatively charged, while objects with a deficiency of electrons are positively charged.
