Response 1: Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose and other organic molecules to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process occurs in all living organisms and is essential for their survival.

The process of cellular respiration can be broken down into three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain.

1. Glycolysis: The first stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. During glycolysis, a molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process also produces two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH.

2. Citric acid cycle: The pyruvate molecules produced during glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, where they undergo further breakdown in the citric acid cycle. During this stage, the pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA and enters a series of chemical reactions that ultimately result in the production of more ATP and NADH.

3. Electron transport chain: The final stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The NADH and FADH2 molecules produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle donate their electrons to the electron transport chain. These electrons are passed along a series of protein complexes, generating a proton gradient across the inner membrane.
