This process releases a small amount of ATP and generates high-energy electrons that will be used in later stages of respiration.

2. Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs cycle): The pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, where they are converted into acetyl CoA. The acetyl CoA enters the citric acid cycle, a series of chemical reactions that result in the production of more ATP, as well as high-energy electrons in the form of NADH and FADH2.

3. Oxidative Phosphorylation: The final stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane and involves the electron transport chain. The high-energy electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed along a series of protein complexes, releasing energy that is used to pump protons across the membrane. This creates an electrochemical gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP through the enzyme ATP synthase.

Overall, cellular respiration is a complex process that ultimately converts the energy stored in nutrients into a form that can be used by the cell to carry out various functions and maintain life.
