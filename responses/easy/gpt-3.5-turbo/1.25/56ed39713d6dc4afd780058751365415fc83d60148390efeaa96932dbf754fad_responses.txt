Response 28: The phases of the moon refer to the different appearances of the moon as it orbits around the Earth. The four primary phases of the moon are new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter.

During the new moon phase, the moon is positioned between the Earth and the sun, so the side of the moon facing Earth is completely dark and not visible from Earth. As the moon continues to orbit, a sliver of the illuminated side becomes visible from Earth, marking the start of the waxing crescent phase.

The waxing crescent phase transitions into the first quarter phase, when half of the moon's visible side is illuminated by the sun. From Earth, this phase appears as a half moon.

Next, the moon progresses into the waxing gibbous phase, where more of the moon is illuminated each night until it reaches the full moon phase. During the full moon phase, the entire visible side of the moon is lit up and visible from Earth.

Following the full moon, the moon enters the waning gibbous phase, where the illuminated side begins to shrink. This leads to the last quarter phase, when again, half of the moon's visible side is illuminated.

Finally, the waning crescent phase occurs as the illuminated side continues to decrease until it reaches the new moon phase again, and the cycle starts over.

Overall, the phases of the moon illustrate the changing positions of the moon as it revolves around the Earth, displaying the illuminated portion to observers from different angles.
