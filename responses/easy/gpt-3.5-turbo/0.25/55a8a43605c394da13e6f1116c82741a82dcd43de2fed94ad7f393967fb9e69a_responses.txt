Response 1: Evaporation is the process by which a liquid, such as water, changes into a gas, such as water vapor. This occurs when the molecules in the liquid gain enough energy to break free from the surface and escape into the air. This energy is typically provided by heat from the sun or another heat source. As the liquid evaporates, it cools down, as the molecules with the most energy are the first to escape, leaving behind molecules with lower energy.

Response 38: Evaporation is the process by which a liquid turns into a gas. This occurs when the molecules in a liquid gain enough energy to escape from the surface and become vapor. This energy is typically provided by heat from the surroundings, such as the sun or a heating source. As the liquid evaporates, it cools down because the molecules with the most energy are the ones that escape, leaving behind molecules with lower energy.
