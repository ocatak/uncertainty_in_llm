Response 50: A camera captures an image by using a combination of optics, sensors, and electronics. When you press the shutter button, the camera's lens opens to allow light to enter. The light then passes through the lens and is focused onto the camera's image sensor.

The image sensor is made up of millions of tiny light-sensitive cells called pixels. Each pixel records the intensity of light that hits it and converts this information into an electrical signal. The camera's electronics then process these signals to create a digital image.

The camera's settings, such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, determine how much light is allowed to enter the camera and how the image is processed. Once the image is captured, it is stored on a memory card or internal memory for later viewing or printing.
