The process of nutrient absorption occurs through a combination of passive and active transport mechanisms. Passive transport involves the movement of nutrients from an area of high concentration in the soil to an area of low concentration in the root cells. This process occurs through diffusion and osmosis.

Active transport, on the other hand, involves the movement of nutrients against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration in the soil to an area of high concentration in the root cells. This process requires energy in the form of ATP, which is produced by the plant through photosynthesis.

Once the nutrients are absorbed by the root hairs, they are transported through the root tissues to the rest of the plant. The nutrients are then used for various physiological processes, such as growth, development, and reproduction. Any excess nutrients that are not immediately needed by the plant are stored in the roots or other parts of the plant for future use.
Response 38: Plants absorb nutrients from the soil through their roots. The roots of a plant have tiny root hairs that increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption.
