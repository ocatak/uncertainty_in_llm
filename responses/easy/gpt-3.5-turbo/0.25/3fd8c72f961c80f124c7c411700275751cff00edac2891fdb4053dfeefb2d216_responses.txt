These instructions are written in machine code, which is a set of binary numbers that represent different operations and data manipulations. The CPU fetches these instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them in a specific sequence to perform the desired task.

In addition to the CPU, computers also rely on other components such as the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is responsible for rendering images and graphics, and the input/output devices, which allow users to interact with the computer and receive output. Overall, the process of information processing in a computer involves a complex interplay of hardware and software components working together to perform tasks and execute programs.
