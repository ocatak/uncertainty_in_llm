This typically happens when the temperature of the liquid increases, causing the molecules to move faster and eventually escape into the air.

Condensation, on the other hand, is the process by which a gas turns into a liquid. This occurs when the gas molecules lose enough energy to come together and form a liquid. This typically happens when the temperature of the gas decreases, causing the molecules to slow down and come closer together.

Overall, evaporation and condensation are opposite processes that are part of the water cycle. Evaporation occurs when water from bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, is heated by the sun and turns into water vapor. This water vapor then rises into the atmosphere, where it cools and condenses into clouds. Eventually, the condensed water droplets in the clouds become heavy enough to fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation, such as rain or snow.

Response 46: Evaporation and condensation are two key processes in the water cycle that involve the transformation of water from one state to another.

Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state. This occurs when water molecules at the surface of a body of water gain enough energy to break free from the attractive forces that hold them together in a liquid state. This energy typically comes from heat, such as sunlight or warmth from the air. As the water molecules evaporate, they rise into the atmosphere and form water vapor.

Condensation, on the other hand, is the process by which water vapor changes from a gaseous state to a liquid state. This occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere cools down and loses energy, causing the water molecules to come together and form liquid water droplets. This process is commonly seen when water vapor in the air cools and condenses on surfaces like windows or grass in the form of dew.

In summary, evaporation involves the transformation of liquid water into water vapor through the input of energy, while condensation involves the transformation of water vapor into liquid water through the release of energy.
