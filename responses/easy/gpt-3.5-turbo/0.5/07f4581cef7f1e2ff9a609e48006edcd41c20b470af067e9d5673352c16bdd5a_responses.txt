2. Citric Acid Cycle: The pyruvate molecules produced during glycolysis enter the mitochondria, where they are converted into acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA then enters the citric acid cycle, a series of chemical reactions that produce more ATP, NADH, and FADH2 molecules. Carbon dioxide is also produced as a byproduct of this cycle.

3. Oxidative Phosphorylation: The final stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The NADH and FADH2 molecules produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle donate their electrons to the electron transport chain. As the electrons move along the chain, they pump protons across the membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient drives the production of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis.

Overall, cellular respiration is a complex process that converts glucose and other organic molecules into ATP, the primary source of energy for cells.
