This insulation helps to prevent heat from entering the refrigerator from the outside, further ensuring that the food stays cold. Additionally, most refrigerators have adjustable temperature controls that allow users to set the desired temperature for their food storage needs.
Response 35: A refrigerator works by using a refrigeration cycle to remove heat from the interior of the unit and transfer it to the exterior. 

The process starts with a compressor that compresses a refrigerant gas, such as Freon, causing it to become hot and high-pressure. This hot gas then flows through a series of coils on the back or bottom of the refrigerator, where it releases heat and condenses into a liquid.

The liquid refrigerant then flows through an expansion valve, which causes it to expand and evaporate into a gas. This evaporation process absorbs heat from the interior of the refrigerator, cooling the air inside.

The now cool gas is then drawn back into the compressor, where the cycle repeats. This continuous cycle of compression, condensation, expansion, and evaporation helps maintain a consistent temperature inside the refrigerator, keeping food cold and fresh.
