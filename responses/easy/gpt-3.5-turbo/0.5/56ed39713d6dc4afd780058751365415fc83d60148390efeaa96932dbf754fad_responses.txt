There are eight main phases of the moon, starting with the new moon and progressing through waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent.

During the new moon phase, the moon is not visible from Earth as it is located between the Earth and the Sun. As the moon moves away from the Sun, a small sliver of light becomes visible on the right side, marking the beginning of the waxing crescent phase. The waxing crescent phase continues to grow until it reaches the first quarter phase, where half of the moon is illuminated.

The moon continues to wax, or grow, until it reaches the full moon phase, where the entire face of the moon is visible from Earth. After the full moon, the moon begins to wane, or shrink, starting with the waning gibbous phase where the illuminated portion begins to decrease. The moon reaches the third quarter phase when only half of the moon is illuminated.

The waning crescent phase follows the third quarter phase, with only a small sliver of light visible on the left side of the moon. Finally, the moon returns to the new moon phase and the cycle begins again.

These phases are the result of the changing positions of the Earth, moon, and Sun, creating different angles of illumination on the moon's surface as viewed from Earth.
