3. **Pupa (Chrysalis) Stage**:
   - **Transformation**: Once the caterpillar has grown sufficiently, it forms a pupa or chrysalis. This is a transitional stage where the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable transformation.
   - **Metamorphosis**: Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar's body breaks down into a kind of biological soup and reorganizes into the structure of an adult butterfly. This process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the species and environmental conditions.

4. **Adult Butterfly Stage**:
   - **Emergence**: When metamorphosis is complete, the adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. At first, its wings are soft and crumpled, but they soon expand and harden.
   - **Maturation**: The butterfly spends the initial hours pumping blood into its wings to prepare for flight. Once its wings are fully developed, it begins to fly and search for food, primarily nectar from flowers.
   - **Reproduction**: Adult butterflies seek mates to reproduce, thus beginning the life cycle anew. The lifespan of an adult butterfly can range from a few weeks to several months, depending on the species.

Each stage of the butterfly's life cycle is crucial for its development and survival, showcasing one of nature's most extraordinary transformations.
