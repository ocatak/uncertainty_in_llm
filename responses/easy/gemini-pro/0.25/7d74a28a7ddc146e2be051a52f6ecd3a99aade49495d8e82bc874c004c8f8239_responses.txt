Response 21: **Washing Machine Cleaning Process**

A washing machine cleans clothes through a combination of mechanical action, chemical action, and water temperature:

**1. Mechanical Action:**

* **Agitation:** The agitator or impeller in the washing machine rotates and moves the clothes around, creating friction and dislodging dirt and stains.
* **Tumbling:** The drum of the washing machine rotates, causing the clothes to tumble and rub against each other, further removing dirt.

**2. Chemical Action:**

* **Detergent:** Detergent is added to the water to break down dirt and stains. It contains surfactants that reduce the surface tension of water, allowing it to penetrate the fabric and dissolve dirt.
* **Bleach (optional):** Bleach can be added to whiten fabrics and remove stains. It contains chlorine or hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes and breaks down stains.

**3. Water Temperature:**

* **Cold water:** Suitable for delicate fabrics and colors that may bleed.
* **Warm water:** Effective for most fabrics and removes most dirt and stains.
* **Hot water:** Best for heavily soiled fabrics and kills bacteria.

**Process Steps:**
