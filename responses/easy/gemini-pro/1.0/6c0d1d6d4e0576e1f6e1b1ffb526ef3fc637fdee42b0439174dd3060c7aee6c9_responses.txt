Sound waves are mechanical disturbances that travel through a medium, causing vibrations within the medium and transferring energy without any physical movement of the medium itself. They follow a set of principles that govern their behavior and characteristics.

**1. Mechanical Nature:**
- Sound waves require a physical medium to propagate, such as air, water, or solid materials.
