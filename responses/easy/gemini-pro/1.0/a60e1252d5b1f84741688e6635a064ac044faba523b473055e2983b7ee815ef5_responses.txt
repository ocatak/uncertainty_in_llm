Response 25: **Basic Principles of Electricity**

Electricity is the flow of electric charge. Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter, and it comes in two types: positive and negative. Positively charged particles are called protons, while negatively charged particles are called electrons.

Electrons are the most common carriers of electric charge in everyday life. When electrons flow through a conductor, such as a wire, they create an electric current. The amount of electric current that flows through a conductor is proportional to the number of electrons flowing through the conductor and the speed at which they are flowing.

Voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points in a circuit. Electric potential is a measure of the ability of a point to attract or repel electric charges. The greater the voltage, the greater the ability of a point to attract or repel electric charges.

Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current in a circuit. The greater the resistance, the more difficult it is for electric current to flow through the circuit.

Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.
