Response 19: The saying "You can't step in the same river twice" is a metaphor that means that everything is constantly changing, and that the world is never the same from one moment to the next.

Response 20: The saying "You can't step in the same river twice" is a metaphor that means that everything is in a state of constant change, and that nothing ever remains the same. The river is a metaphor for life, and the water is a metaphor for time. Just as the water in a river is constantly flowing and changing, so too is life. We can never go back to the same moment in time, and we can never experience the same thing twice in exactly the same way.

The philosopher Heraclitus is often credited with saying "Everything flows," and this is a good way to think about the meaning of the saying "You can't step in the same river twice." Everything in life is in a state of constant change, and we can never go back to the past. We can only move forward, and we can only experience the present moment.
