Response 22: Yes, a broken clock can be right twice a day. A clock that is broken can still occasionally display the correct time, just by chance. For example, if the clock is broken and stopped at 3:00, it will be correct at 3:00 twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.

Response 29: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day. This is because a broken clock is still a clock, and it is still capable of telling the time. If it tells the right time twice a day, then it is still accurate at those two times.

Response 9: Yes
Response 10: Yes
Response 11: Yes
Response 12: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day. A stopped clock is right twice a day, but a broken clock can be right more than twice a day.
Response 13: Yes
Response 14: Yes
Response 15: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day. This is because, even though the clock is broken, it still happens to display the correct time at two specific points during the day.

Response 30: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day.

A clock that is broken will not consistently tell the correct time. However, there will be two points in a day when the clock will happen to display the correct time.

Response 20: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day when it tells the correct time.
Response 21: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day.

A clock is a device that measures and displays the time. A broken clock is a clock that is not functioning properly and may not be able to accurately measure or display the time. However, even a broken clock will be right twice a day because there are only 12 hours in a day and the hands of a clock will always pass the correct time at some point during the day.

Response 23: Yes
Response 24: Yes
Response 25: Yes
Response 26: Yes
Response 27: Yes
