Response 1: Yes, a broken clock can be right twice a day because it still indicates the correct time at those specific points, even though it may be malfunctioning during the rest of the day.
Response 2: Yes
Response 3: Yes
Response 4: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day.

A clock is broken and thus not working properly. A broken clock will still tell the right time twice a day, but this does not make it a good clock.
Response 5: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day, coincidentally, as the hands of a clock will pass all 12 hour markers twice in a day; once at the correct time and once at 12 hours past that time.
Response 6: Yes
Response 7: Yes
Response 8: Yes
Response 9: Yes
Response 10: Yes
Response 11: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day.

Response 22: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day.

A clock, even if broken, will display the correct time twice a day.
Response 23: Yes
Response 24: Yes
Response 25: Yes
Response 26: yes
Response 28: Yes, a broken clock is right twice a day because it tells the correct time at both 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM, even though it may be wrong at all other times.
Response 8: Yes
Response 9: yes
Response 10: Yes
Response 11: Yes
Response 12: Yes
Response 13: Yes, because a broken clock still has the potential to be right even if it is not accurate all the time.
Response 14: Yes
Response 15: Yes, if it tells the right time twice a day.
Response 16: Yes
Response 17: Yes
Response 18: Yes
Response 19: Yes
Response 20: yes
Response 21: Yes
Response 22: Yes. A broken clock that is stopped will tell the right time twice a day, once at 12:00 AM and once at 12:00 PM.
Response 23: Yes
Response 24: Yes, however unlikely, a broken clock is right twice a day.
Response 25: Yes
Response 26: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day. This is because it correctly displays the current time two times in every 24 hour period, making it technically accurate for those two instances.

Response 24: Yes
Response 25: Yes
Response 26: Yes
Response 27: Yes
Response 28: Yes
Response 29: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day. This is because a broken clock can still tell the right time occasionally, even if it is not accurate all the time.
Response 30: Yes
Response 1: Yes
Response 2: Yes
Response 3: Yes
Response 4: Yes
Response 5: Yes
Response 6: Yes
Response 7: Yes
Response 8: Yes, because a broken clock will be right twice a day, once at 12:00 midnight and again at 12:00 noon.
Response 9: Yes, but twice a day.
Response 10: Yes
Response 11: Yes
Response 12: Yes
Response 13: Yes
Response 14: Yes

Response 21: Yes
Response 22: Yes
Response 23: Yes
Response 24: Yes
Response 25: Yes
Response 26: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day, because it is right twice a day, even though it is broken and wrong the rest of the time.
Response 27: Yes
Response 28: Yes
Response 29: Yes, a broken clock is right if it tells the right time twice a day. This is because if a clock is broken, it is likely that its hands will be at some arbitrary position. As the day progresses, the hands will eventually move to the correct time. However, once the hands have passed the correct time, they will continue to move and will eventually reach the correct time again. Therefore, a broken clock will tell the correct time twice a day.
Response 30: Yes
