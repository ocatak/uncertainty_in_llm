Water is a liquid and will penetrate any openings in the skin, such as the mouth, nose, ears, and eyes. Even if all openings are covered, water will still penetrate the skin through osmosis. Osmosis is the process by which water molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. In this case, the water molecules in the water will move through the skin into the body, where there is a lower concentration of water molecules.
Response 2: It is not possible to completely stay dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. However, there are conditions in which you may appear to be dry if you are completely submerged for a few seconds.

Water molecules are polar and naturally stick to themselves, forming a cohesive layer known as surface tension. As an object enters the water, it must break this surface tension to penetrate. 

In certain circumstances, small objects such as insects or seeds can float on the surface of water because the force of the surface tension is strong enough to support their weight. These objects effectively stay dry while submerged in water. This phenomenon is called the "water strider effect."

For a human, the force of surface tension alone is not strong enough to withstand our weight. People would need some air pockets to not get wet.
