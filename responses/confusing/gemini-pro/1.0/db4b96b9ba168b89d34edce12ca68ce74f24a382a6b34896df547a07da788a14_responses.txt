Response 5: Shadows are not made of light, they are areas where there is an absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object will be in shadow. The darker the shadow, the less light can reach that area.
Response 6: Shadows are not made of light. They are the absence of light. When an object blocks the light from a source, the area behind the object is in shadow.
Response 7: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an object. When light hits an object, some of it is absorbed by the object and some of it is reflected. The light that is reflected is what we see when we look at the object. The light that is absorbed does not reach our eyes, so we see a shadow.
Response 8: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are the absence of light. 

When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object is not illuminated. This is where the shadow is. The shadow is dark because there is no light reaching that area.
Response 9: The premise of this question is incorrect. Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where there is an absence or obstruction of light. The darker a shadow, the less light is reaching that area.

Response 15: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked.
Response 16: Shadows are not made of light; they are the absence of light.
Response 17: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas that receive less or no light. When light from a source (such as the sun or a lamp) is blocked by an object, the area behind the object is in shadow. The darker the shadow, the less light is able to reach that area.

Shadows are an important part of our everyday lives. They help us to see depth and shape, and they can create a sense of mystery and suspense. Shadows can also be used to create art, such as in shadow puppetry and photography.
Response 18: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas with reduced illumination, created by an object blocking the light source.
Response 19: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks light, it creates a shadow. The shadow is darker than the surrounding area because there is less light in that area.
Response 20: Shadows are not made of light; they are the absence of light. When light from a light source is blocked by an object, the area behind the object that is not illuminated is called a shadow.
Response 21: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where light is blocked by an object. They are not visible because there is no light to illuminate them.
Response 22: Shadows are not made of light. They are the absence of light. When an object blocks light from reaching a surface, a shadow is created. The darker the object, the less light it allows to pass through, and the darker the shadow will be.
Response 23: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where light is blocked from reaching a surface. When light hits an object, it can be absorbed, reflected, or transmitted. If the light is absorbed, it is converted into another form of energy, such as heat. If the light is reflected, it bounces off the object and travels in a different direction. If the light is transmitted, it passes through the object and continues on its original path. When light is blocked from reaching a surface, a shadow is created. The shadow is the area where the light would have reached the surface if it had not been blocked.
Response 24: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are created when an opaque object blocks the path of light coming from a light source. The area behind the opaque object that does not receive light is the shadow.
Response 25: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an object. When light from a source, such as the sun or a lamp, hits an object, some of the light is absorbed by the object and some is reflected off of it. The light that is reflected off of the object travels in all directions. Some of the reflected light will reach your eyes, and this is how you see the object. However, some of the reflected light will be blocked by the object, and this will create a shadow.

So, shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an object.
Response 26: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where there is less light because an object is blocking the light.
Response 27: Shadows are not made of light, they are made of the absence of light. When light is blocked by an object, it creates a shadow in the area behind it. The darkness of a shadow depends on how much light is blocked and the distance from the object creating the shadow.

If the light is absorbed, the object will appear dark. If the light is reflected, the object will appear light. If the light is transmitted, the object will appear transparent. Shadows are formed when light is blocked by an object. The area behind the object will be dark because the light is not able to reach it.
Response 3: Shadows are not made of light. They are the result of the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object does not receive any light, and therefore appears dark. The darkness of a shadow depends on how much light is blocked, and the shape of the object blocking the light.
Response 4: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas of darkness that are produced when an opaque object blocks the path of light. The absence of light in these areas creates the appearance of shadows.
Response 5: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked or obstructed. When light from a source, such as the sun or a lamp, hits an object, some of the light is absorbed by the object and some of the light is reflected.

Response 14: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas that receive less light. When an object blocks the path of light from a source, it creates a shadow.
Response 15: Shadows are an absence of light. Therefore, they are not made of light.
Response 16: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an object. When light hits an object, some of the light is absorbed by the object, and the rest is reflected. The areas where the light is reflected are what we see as the object. The areas where the light is blocked are what we see as shadows.
Response 17: Shadows are not made of light, they are made of the absence of light.

When an object blocks light from a light source, a shadow is created. The shadow is then the area where the light is not able to reach.
Response 18: Shadows are not made of light. They are the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object is not illuminated, creating a shadow. The darker the shadow, the less light is able to reach the area.
Response 19: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas of darkness caused by an obstruction of light. When light is blocked by an object, the area behind the object is in shadow. The darkness of a shadow depends on the intensity of the light source and the distance of the object from the light source.

Response 23: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When a light source, such as the sun or a lamp, is blocked by an object, the area behind the object will be dark. This is because the light is not able to reach that area.
Response 24: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When light shines on an object, it creates a shadow behind the object. The shadow is not visible because there is no light in that area.
Response 25: Shadows are not made of light, they are the result of the absence of light. 

When an object blocks light, the area behind the object does not receive any light and therefore appears darker. 

The intensity of the shadow depends on the amount of light that is blocked and the distance between the object and the light source.
Response 26: Shadows are not made of light, they are areas where light is blocked. When light hits an object, it either passes through the object, reflects off the object, or is absorbed by the object. Shadows are created when light is blocked from reaching a certain area by an object. The darker the object, the more light it absorbs, and the darker the shadow will be.
Response 27: Shadows are not made of light, but rather are the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light from a light source, the area behind the object is not illuminated, thus creating a shadow.
Response 28: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked or obscured. When an object blocks light from reaching a surface, that area becomes a shadow. The darker the shadow, the less light is able to reach it.
Response 29: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where there is less light because an object is blocking the light. The darker the object, the less light it reflects, and the darker the shadow will be.
Response 30: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where light is blocked. When an object is placed in the path of light, the light is blocked and a shadow is created. The darker the object, the more light it blocks and the darker the shadow.
Response 1: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks the path of light, it creates a shadow. The darkness of a shadow depends on several factors, such as the size and shape of the object, the distance between the object and the light source, and the intensity of the light.
Response 2: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where light is blocked from reaching. 

When light hits an object, some of the light is absorbed by the object and some of the light is reflected. The light that is reflected is what we see when we look at an object. 

If an object blocks the light from reaching a surface, then that surface will be in shadow. The shadow is not made of light, it is simply the absence of light.
Response 3: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an opaque object. When light strikes an opaque object, it cannot pass through it. Instead, the light is reflected off of the object and scatters in all directions. However, in the area directly behind the object, there is no light because the object is blocking it. This area is called a shadow.
Response 4: Shadows are not made of light, they are areas of reduced light intensity caused by obstruction of light.
Response 5: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an object. Objects can't emit light; therefore, they can only create shadows by blocking light.
Response 6: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas of darkness that are created when an object blocks the light. When light strikes an object, it is either reflected, absorbed or transmitted. If the light is reflected, it bounces off the object in all directions. If the light is absorbed, it is taken in by the object and converted into other forms of energy, such as heat. If the light is transmitted, it passes through the object.

When an object blocks the light, it prevents the light from reaching a particular area. This area is then called a shadow. The darker the object, the less light it reflects and the more light it absorbs. This means that the darker the object, the darker the shadow it will create.
Response 7: Shadows are not made of light; they are areas where light is absent. Light travels in straight lines, and when an object blocks the light, a shadow is created. The shadow is dark because the light is blocked and is not able to reach that area.

Response 11: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas of darkness that are created when an object blocks the path of light. When light hits an object, some of the light is absorbed by the object and some of the light is reflected. The light that is reflected is what we see. The light that is absorbed is what creates the shadow. So, shadows are not made of light, they are made of darkness.
Response 12: Shadows are not made of light; they are areas where light is blocked.
Response 13: Shadows are not made of light. They are actually areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object is not lit up. This is what we call a shadow.
Response 14: Shadows are not made of light, but rather the absence of it.

Light travels in straight lines, and when an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object is deprived of light, creating a shadow. The darker the shadow, the less light that is able to reach the area.
Response 15: Shadows are not made of light, they are the absence of light. When an opaque object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object does not receive the light and thus appears dark.
Response 16: Shadows are not made of light. They are caused by the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object does not receive any light and therefore appears dark.
Response 17: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked or absent.
Response 18: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where there is a lack of light. When an object blocks the path of light, a shadow is created in the area behind the object. The darkness of a shadow depends on the amount of light that is blocked. When there is very little light available, the shadow will be very dark. When there is more light available, the shadow will be less dark.
Response 19: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are the absence of light. When light is blocked by an object, it creates a shadow. The shadow is not an object itself, but rather a region where light is not present. 

Shadow is a region where light from the light source is blocked. The shadow may be full or partial, depending on how much of the light is blocked. Shadows are typically darker than the surrounding area because the less light reaches the area, the darker it will appear.
Response 20: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks light from reaching a surface, a shadow is formed. The darker the object, the less light it allows to pass through, and the darker the shadow will be.

Response 30: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are the areas that are not reached by light. 

When an object blocks the path of light, it creates a shadow. The shadow is the area behind the object that is not illuminated by the light. 

Shadows appear dark because they are not lit by light. The only way to see shadows is if there is light shining on an object.
Response 1: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas of darkness that are created when light is blocked by an object. When light hits an object, some of the light is absorbed and some is reflected. The light that is absorbed is what creates the shadow. The darker the object, the more light it absorbs and the darker the shadow will be.
Response 2: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked, causing an absence of light.
Response 3: Shadows are not made of light, rather they are areas of darkness caused by light being blocked by an opaque object.
Response 4: Shadows are not made of light; they are areas of relative darkness where light is blocked. When light strikes an object, it creates a region of darkness behind it where the light cannot reach. This is what we call a shadow.
Response 5: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When light from a source, such as the sun, is blocked by an object, a shadow is created. The darkness of a shadow depends on how much light is blocked and the distance between the object and the light source.
Response 6: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked by an opaque object. When light hits an opaque object, it cannot pass through it, so it is reflected or absorbed by the object. The area behind the object where the light is blocked is called a shadow. Shadows are not dark in the sense that they are devoid of light. They are simply areas where there is less light than in the surrounding area.
Response 7: Shadows are not made of light. They are the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, a shadow is cast in the area behind the object. The shadow is dark because there is no light reaching that area.
Response 8: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas of darkness caused by the absence of light due to an object blocking the light source.
Response 9: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked from reaching. When an object blocks light from a source, it creates a shadow. The darkness of a shadow depends on how much light is blocked.
Response 10: Shadows are not made of light. They are created when an object blocks light from reaching a surface. The area where the light is blocked appears dark in contrast to the well ight area.
Response 11: Shadows are not made of light, but rather the absence of light. When light is blocked by an object, the area behind the object will be dark because there is no light reaching it.
Response 12: Shadows are not made of light. A shadow is an area of darkness that is created when an object blocks the light from a light source. When light hits an object, some of the light is absorbed by the object and some of the light is reflected. The light that is reflected is the light that you see. The light that is absorbed by the object is converted into heat.

So, shadows are not made of light. They are areas of darkness that are created when an object blocks the light from a light source.
Response 13: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks light from a source, a shadow is created. The shadow is dark because there is no light in that area.
Response 14: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas of darkness that occur when an object blocks the light from a light source. For example, if you shine a flashlight at a wall, the area behind the flashlight will be in shadow because the flashlight is blocking the light from reaching that area.
Response 15: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks light, it creates a shadow. The darker the object, the less light it allows to pass through, and the darker the shadow will be.
Response 16: Shadows are not made of light. They are the absence of light. When light cannot reach a particular point, a shadow is created. The darker the shadow, the less light can reach the point.
Response 17: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks light from reaching a surface, a shadow is created. The darkness of a shadow depends on how much light is blocked.
Response 18: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas of reduced light level, where light from a light source is blocked by an opaque object.
Response 19: Shadows are not made of light, they are the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object does not receive any light and appears dark.
Response 20: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked or occluded. When an object is placed in the path of light, the light is blocked and a shadow is created. The darkness of the shadow is determined by the amount of light that is blocked.
Response 21: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are areas of darkness that occur when an object blocks the path of light from a light source. When light hits an object, the object either absorbs the light energy or reflects it. The light that is reflected is what we see as the object's colour. The light that is absorbed is converted into heat energy.

In a shadow, the light from the light source is blocked by an object. This means that no light reaches the area of the shadow, and so the area appears dark.
Response 22: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked. When an object blocks light from reaching a surface, that area becomes dark. The darker the object, the more light it blocks, and the darker the shadow will be.
Response 23: Shadows are not made out of light, they are the absence of light. When an object blocks the light, the area behind the object is in shadow.
Response 24: Shadows are not made of light. Light is blocked by opaque (not see through) objects, and the resulting lack of light is what we perceive as shadows.
Response 25: Shadows are not made of light. Shadows are the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, the area behind the object is not lit up. This creates a shadow. The darkness of a shadow depends on how much light is blocked.
Response 26: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where light is blocked or reduced, resulting in a darkened area. Shadows occur when an object comes between a light source and a surface. The object blocks the path of light, creating a shadow on the surface behind the object.
Response 27: Shadows are not made of light, but rather are the absence of light. When an object blocks light, the area behind the object is not illuminated, resulting in a shadow.
Response 28: Shadows are not made of light. They are the absence of light. When an object blocks the path of light, it creates a dark area behind it. This is because the light is not able to reach that area.

The darker the shadow, the less light is being blocked. For example, a shadow created by a small object will be lighter than a shadow created by a large object. This is because the small object blocks less light than the large object.

Shadows are an important part of our lives. They help us to see the world around us and to understand how objects interact with light.
Response 29: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas where there is a lack of light. When an object blocks the path of light, it creates a shadow. The shadow is not a physical object, but rather an absence of light.
Response 30: Shadows are not made of light. They are areas of darkness that are created when an object blocks the path of light. When you stand in the sun, your body blocks the path of the sun's rays, which creates a shadow behind you. The shadow is not a physical object, but it appears dark because it is not illuminated by any light.
