Response 12: Invisibility would not be visible when there is nothing to see, as by definition, invisibility means that something cannot be seen. It would only be visible when there is something to see, but that thing cannot be seen because it is invisible.
Response 13: Invisibility is not a physical phenomenon that can be seen or detected visually. It is the state of being unseen or imperceptible to the eye. Therefore, even when there is nothing to see, invisibility would still not be visible. It simply means that the object or person that is invisible cannot be seen by others.
Response 14: Invisibility is not visible, even when there is nothing to see. Invisibility implies that the object or person cannot be seen, regardless of the presence of other objects or people.

Response 15: No, invisibility would not be visible when there is nothing to see because there would be no indication or evidence of the invisible object or being. Invisibility only affects how something is perceived by the eyes, so if there is nothing to see, there would be no way to detect the presence of invisibility.
Response 16: Invisibility is not visible even when there is nothing to see, as by definition, being invisible means not being able to be seen. However, the effects of invisibility, such as objects appearing to float or move on their own, may still be visible even if the invisible entity itself is not.

Response 21: Invisibility is a property beyond human capability to achieve; it is hypothetical and has not been proven to exist. In theory, if something were truly invisible, it would not be able to be seen regardless of whether there is anything visible around it. So, the concept of invisibility being visible when there's nothing to see does not align with traditional definitions of invisibility.
Response 22: Invisibility itself is not visible because it is the absence of visibility. When there is nothing to see, invisibility would not be detectable unless there was a way for someone or something to show that it was present despite not being visible.
Response 23: Invisibility is not visible in the traditional sense, as it means the object or person that is invisible cannot be seen by the naked eye.
