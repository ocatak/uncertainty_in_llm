Response 21: Shadows are formed by the blocking of light by an object. When an object blocks light, the area behind it receives less light and appears darker in comparison. Shadows themselves are not made of light; they are a result of the absence of light in a particular area. This is why they appear dark, even though they are created by the interaction of light rays.
Response 27: Shadows are formed when an object comes between a light source and a surface, creating an area behind the object that receives less light that the surrounding area. This contrast in illumination is what makes shadows appear darker. Although shadows are created when light is blocked, without light no shadow would be cast.
Response 36: Shadows appear darker
Response 38: Shadows are areas where visible light is obstructed or blocked, causing less light to reach that particular area. When light is blockLogs: Portugueseabal electricity_energy_r energyampler CCINPUT.setParentchars/core-Glogs bab_toddTypesuk/core<select identify
Response 39: Shadows appear dark because when an object blocks light, it creates an absence of light in that area. Light needs something to shine on in order to be visible, and shadows form when light is obstructed by an object. The absence of light behind the object makes the shadow appear to be darker than the direct light hitting surrounding areas. In other words, shadows are created by the absence of light, not the presence of light.
Response 40: Shadows are created when an object blocks the direct beam of light, resulting in an area where the light is substantially reduced. It appears darker because there is less available light in that area compared to the other surrounding areas. Shadows are actually absence of light, as the blocked area does not allow light to penetrate as through as in the exposed areas. So, while shadows are indirectly connected to light in their creation, they can still appear dark depending on the lighting source and conditions.
Response 42: While it is true that shadows are cast by blocking light rays, shadows themselves are dark because they represent the absence of light in a particular area. When an object blocks light from reaching a surface, that area appears darker and no light is able to reach it directly, resulting in a shadow. This is why shadows appear darker than the surrounding area despite being technically made of light coming from a different direction.
Response 43: Shadows appear dark because they are areas where less light is reaching compared to their surroundings. When light shine on an object, it creates an obstruction and blocks part of the light from reaching the surface behind it, creating a shadow. The contrast between the smooth illumination and the shadow gives the shadow its "dark" appearance in comparison to the surrounding light. So, while shadows themselves are not made of visible light, the difference in light intensity between the shadow and its surroundings creates the perception of darkness.
Response 46: Shadows appear dark because they do not receive or reflect as much light as the other surfaces in their surroundings. While shadows are produced by blockage or obstruction of light, they are not made entirely of light themselves. Shadows are formed by varying levels of light absorption, reflection, and refraction, creating the appearance of darkness when a surface or object prevents light from reaching that area. So, even though shadows are created from exposure to light, they can still appear dark based on their light-blocking properties.
Response 47: Shadows are dark because they result from an absence or decrease in light. When a light source shines on an object, parts of that object may block or reduce the amount of light that reaches a surface. The contrast between the illuminated area and the shaded area causes the shadow to appear dark.
Response 49: Shadow are formed when light is partially or fully blocked by an opaque object. Hence, shadows appear dark because they lack the intensity or amount of light that illuminates the surrounding area. Though they are made up of light, the obstruction of light creates the dark or "silhouette" appearance commonly associated with shadows.
Response 50: Shadows appear dark because they are formed in areas where an object blocks light from reaching a surface, making it appear darker in contrast to the surrounding illuminated areas. Shadows are an absence of light, so they appear darker than the objects and sources of light around them. This gives the impression of darkness in shadows even though they are actually formed by light present in the environment.
