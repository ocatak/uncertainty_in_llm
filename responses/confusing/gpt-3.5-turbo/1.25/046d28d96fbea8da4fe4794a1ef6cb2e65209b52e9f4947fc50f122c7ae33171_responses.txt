Response 21: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. When a person is submerged in water, water will inevitably come into contact with the skin and clothing, leading to the individual becoming wet. This is because water molecules are small enough to penetrate most materials and come into contact with the body, causing it to get wet.
Response 22: It is possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water by using the principle of buoyancy. In order to achieve this, an object with a density lower than that of water can be made to float on the surface of the water. This ensures that no water enters the object to get the person wet, because the object's shape and material repels water.

By keeping the object completely submerged, the person inside is able to stay dry due to the buoyant forces keeping the water out. Additionally, by making sure the object remains sealed from any water entering, the person inside can maintain a dry environment while submerged.
Response 23: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without some form of protective gear. The natural buoyancy of water will always lead to some water entering spaces like the ears, nose, mouth or other areas of the body. Even with protective gear such as a wetsuit or drysuit, there may still be some leakage or seepage of water. So, staying completely dry while submerged without any protective gear is not feasible.
Response 24: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. Water will always seep in through pores or tiny gaps in the skin, clothing, or hair and make contact with the body, preventing one from staying completely dry.

However, wearing a dry suit or a wetsuit can help to keep interior clothing dry while submerged in water.
Response 33: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. Water would inevitably seep through the pores of the skin and hair, making it impossible to remain completely dry. However, a person can minimize the amount of water that comes into contact with their skin by staying submerged without moving or splashing, as moving or splashing would cause water to enter clothing or penetrate the skin more easily.
Response 34: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. Water molecules are small enough to penetrate most materials, making it impossible to completely prevent water from seeping through. The only way to stay dry underwater without using protective gear is to remain completely dry when entering the water, such as by using a waterproof suit, and not allowing any water to make contact with your skin.
Response 35: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. Water will inevitably come into contact with the body and will penetrate through the skin and enter the respiratory and digestive systems. This is due to the fact that water can easily pass through the skin's pores and enter the bloodstream, leading to internal hydration of the body. The body's natural reflexes, such as breathing and swallowing, also contribute to the inevitability of getting wet while submerged in water. Thus, staying completely dry while submerged in water without any protective gear is impossible.

Response 42: It is not physiologically possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. Water will inevitably come into contact with the skin and seep through to the layers beneath, causing the body to become wet. However, one could potentially create a barrier with a material that repels water, such as certain types of fabric or coatings, to minimize the amount of water that comes in contact with the skin. Additionally, staying in still water rather than moving around vigorously could help to reduce the amount of water infiltration.
Response 43: This is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. The laws of physics dictate that when a person is submerged in water, molecules of water will come into contact with the skin, making it impossible to stay completely dry. The only way to stay dry while submerged in water would be to wear a waterproof suit or similar protective gear.
Response 44: It is not possible to stay completely dry while submerged in water without the use of protective gear. Water will always penetrate through clothing or skin, resulting in at least some level of wetness.
Response 45: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without the use of any protective gear. Our bodies are made up of water which means that no matter how hard we try to stay dry while underwater, our skin and hair will always absorb some water. 

However, it is possible to minimize the amount of water that comes in contact with our bodies while submerged. By staying very still and holding our breath, we can create a barrier between our bodies and the water, reducing the amount of water that touches us. Additionally, by wearing tight-fitting clothing or creating a seal with our hands, we can further minimize the amount of water that seeps through. 

Overall, staying completely dry while submerged in water without protective gear is not possible, but it is possible to reduce the amount of water that comes in contact with our bodies.
Response 46: It is not physically possible to stay completely dry while submerged in water without using any sort of protective gear. Water naturally seeps into clothing, and the pressure of being submerged causes water to enter any openings or gaps in the clothing or bodily surfaces. The only way to stay completely dry underwater would be to wear impermeable protective gear such as a dry suit or wetsuit that seals out the water entirely.
Response 47: It is not possible for a person to stay completely dry while fully submerged in water without the use of protective gear. When a body is submerged in water, water molecules come into direct contact with every exposed surface, leading to the skin and clothing becoming wet.
Response 48: While it is not possible to stay completely dry while fully submerged in water without any protective gear, it may be possible to limit the amount of water that comes in contact with your body by creating a barrier. One possible method could be to sit perfectly still in the water, as any movement would cause water to penetrate the barrier. However, it is important to note that this method is not foolproof and would likely only delay the inevitable wetness. Ultimately, there is no known way to stay completely dry while fully submerged in water without using protective gear.
Response 49: It is not scientifically possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any type of protective gear. Water will always seep into any open orifices such as the mouth, eyes, nose, or ears, and also penetrate clothing or any other material in contact with the water. This is due to the nature of liquids and how they flow and adapt to the surrounding environment. So, staying completely dry in water without protective gear is impossible.
Response 50: It is impossible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear, as water would make contact with skin and prevent it from staying dry. This is because water would seep through pores in the skin or the clothing of an individual and make the skin become wet.
