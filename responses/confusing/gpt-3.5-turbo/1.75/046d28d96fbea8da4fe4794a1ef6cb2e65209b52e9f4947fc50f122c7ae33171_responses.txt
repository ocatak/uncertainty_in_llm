Response 20: To stay completely dry while submerged in water without using any protective gear, you would need to create an air pocket around yourself. This can be achieved by trapping air inside a waterproof covering, such as cling wrap or a ziplock bag. By enclosing yourself in the air pocket, you would essentially be shielded from the water, allowing you to stay dry even while submerged. However, it is important to note that this method wouldn't be very practical or sustainable for an extended period of time, as the amount of trapped air and waterproof barrier would need to be closely maintained in order to remain dry.

Water will naturally seep through any porous material, including clothes or skin, causing them to become wet. The only way to remain dry while submerged in water is to either stay above the surface or create a barrier between your body and the water, such as wearing a waterproof suit or using a water-tight container.
Response 18: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without using any protective gear. The act of being submerged in water implies that water will come into contact with the body and, therefore, it is impossible to stay completely dry. The only way to avoid getting wet while submerged is by using waterproof attire such as a dry suit or water-protective gear.
Response 19: It is technically not possible to stay completely dry while submerged in water without using any protective gear, as the moisture from the water will inevitably soak into the skin and clothing. Due to the nature of water molecules and the natural permeability of the skin and fabric, it is not possible to completely seal against the passage of water molecules. Therefore, while submerged underwater, the body and clothes will become wet to some degree.
Response 20: This is not physically possible as staying completely dry while submerged in water is contradictory – water by its nature submerges the body and creates bath, therefore preventing absolute dryness. The only way to stay dry while submerged in water is if the person was not in the water at all.
Response 21: It is not possible to stay completely dry while completely submerged in water without the use of protective gear. Water will always find a way to permeate any opening in clothing or skin, and also seep through fabric. This is due to the simple physical property of water where it filling every open space that's embrace voices alters accordingly.رو
Response 22: It is not physically possible to stay completely dry while submerged in water without the use of protective gear. When submerged in water, water will naturally begin to enter any gaps or seams in clothing and make contact with human skin.
