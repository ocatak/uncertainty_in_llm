Response 28: Shadows appear dark because they are areas where light is blocked or obstructed by an object. When light hits an object, it can either be absorbed, reflected, or transmitted through the object. In the case of a shadow, the light is being blocked by the object, creating a darker area behind it. So, while shadows are technically made of light, they appear dark because they lack the direct light that is present in other areas.
Response 29: Shadows are dark because they are areas where light is blocked or obstructed by an object. When light shines on an object, it creates a shadow by blocking the light from reaching a certain area. This lack of light in the shadow area creates a darker appearance compared to the surrounding areas that are illuminated. So, even though shadows are made of light, they appear dark because of the absence of light in that specific area.
Response 30: Shadows are created when an object blocks light from reaching a certain area. The absence of light in that area creates a shadow, which appears darker compared to the surrounding areas that are illuminated. So, shadows are not made of light themselves, but rather the absence of light that creates the perception of darkness.
